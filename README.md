# BASIC CODING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS

## In C language

<b>1) What are the key features of C programming language?</b>

. C was founded by Dennis Ritchie.

. It is flexible and hence can be controlled by the programmer.

. Breaks down larger programs into smaller modules. 

. C comes with support for system programming and hence it compiles and executes with high speed when compared to other high-level languages.

<b> 2) What happens when you compile a program in C? </b>

. Source object file is sent to the compiler it gets processed and is sent as object file. 

<b> 3) What is the use of header files in C? </b>

. Header files contain the definitions and set of rules of the functions being used in the programs.

<b> 4) What happens if a headerfile is included twice? </b>

. If a header file with proper syntax is included twice, the second one gets ignored.

<b> 5) Can a program be compiled without the main() function? </b>

Yes it can be compiled but execution not possible. Using define function it is possible. 

<b> 6) What are the basic data types in C? </b>

. Int Used to represent a number (integer)

. Float Used to represent a decimal number

. Double Used to represent a decimal number with highest precision(digits after the decimal point)

. Char Single character

. Void Special purpose type without any value


<b> 7) Is it possible to store 32768 in an int data type variable?</b>

<b> 8) What are Keywords in C? </b>

They are used to perform different functions. These are Reserved words. Egs: break, else, if

<b> 9) What is the difference between static & global variables? </b>

Global variables are variables which are defined outside the function. The scope of global variables begins at the point where they are defined and lasts till the end of the file/program. Whereas, static global variables are private to the source file where they are defined and do not conflict with other variables in other source files which would have the same name.

<b> 10) What is Memory Leak in C? </b>

When programmers create a memory in the heap and forget to delete it. It decreases the efficiency of the performance of the system.

<b> 11) What is Static and Dynamic memory allocation? </b>

Static memory happens at compile-time. 

Dynamic memory happens at run-time.

<b>12) What is the difference between prefix and postfix? </b>

Prefix - The value stored in the variable a gets incremented and then gets assigned to the same variable.

Postfix - The value stored in the variable a gets incremented after the execution of the particular line.

<b> 13) What is the difference between while (0) and while (1)? </b>

while(0) - program will never get executed

while(1) - infinite loop

Pointer pointing to the memory location which is deleted.

<b> 15) What is the difference between the Void and Null Pointer? </b>

Null pointers generally do not point to a valid location.

Void pointer - the type of data that it points to can be anything.

<b> 16) What is the difference between Pass by value and Pass by reference? </b>

In pass by value, changes made to the arguments in the called function will not be reflected in the calling function. 

Whereas in pass by reference, the changes made to the arguments in the called function will be reflected in the calling function.

<b> 17) What is a pointer on a pointer in C programming language? </b>

A pointer variable that contains the address of another pointer variable is called as a pointer on a pointer.

Enumeration is a data type that consists of named integer constants as a list.

<b> 12) Is there a difference between class and struct? </b>

The only difference between a class and struct are the access modifiers. Struct members are

public by default; class members are private. It is good practice to use classes when you need an

object that has methods and structs when you have a simple data object.

<b> 13) What is a main() and difference b/w void main() and int main()? </b>

main() is an entry point.

When the caller function makes a function call by passing the addresses of actual parameters being passed, then this is called call by reference.

<b> 8) What is typedef? </b>

typedef is a C keyword, used to simplify the existing type declaration syntax.

<b> 9) Why is it usually a bad idea to use gets()? </b>

There would be a restriction in the input range.

<b> 10) Difference between gets() and scanf in C? </b>

scanf() is used to read any data type in C. 

gets() is used to read string input.

Communication says as transferring of message from one place to another place called communication.

<b> Different types of communications? Explain. </b>

Analog and digital communication.

Analog is the process of taking an audio or video signal (the human voice) and translating it into electronic pulses. 

Digital on the other hand is breaking the signal into a binary format where the audio or video data is represented by a series of "1"s and "0"s.

<b>What is diode? </b>

 In electronics, a diode is a two-terminal device. 
 
 Diodes have two active electrodes between which the signal of interest may flow, and most are used for their unidirectional current property.
 
<b> What is transistor? </b>

A transistor is a semiconductor device commonly used to amplify or switch electronic signals.

<b> What is sampling? </b>

The process of obtaining a set of samples from a continuous function of time x(t) is referred to as sampling.

<b> State sampling theorem. </b>

It states that, while taking the samples of a continuous signal, it has to be taken care that the sampling rate is equal to or greater than twice the cut off frequency and the minimum sampling rate is known as the Nyquist rate.

Resistors are very small in size.

It is very easy to carry resistors from one place to another place.

Resistors are very cheap.

<b> What is the principle of microwave? </b>

Microwave essentially means very short wave. The main reason why we have to go in for microwave frequency for communication is that lower frequency band are congested and demand for point to point communication continue to increase.

<b> What is cut-off frequency? </b>

The frequency at which the response is -3dB with respect to the maximum response.

<b> What is pass band? </b>

Passband is the range of frequencies or wavelengths that can pass through a filter without being attenuated.
